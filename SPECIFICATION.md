# System Specification - Library Desk Booking System

## 1. Introduction

### Project Title: Library Desk Booking System (Java)

### Domain: Library Management System
- **Description**: This system is designed for library environments, where users can easily view desk availability, book desks, and cancel reservations. It also allows administrators to manage desk availability, monitor desk usage, and control bookings. The system is designed to streamline the booking process and ensure that no desks are double-booked.

### Problem Statement
The problem addressed by this system is the management of desk availability in libraries, which is often done manually or through inefficient methods. This system aims to automate the desk booking process, enabling users to view desk availability and make reservations online. Additionally, administrators can efficiently manage and oversee the desk booking process, improving user experience and reducing administrative overhead.

### Individual Scope & Feasibility Justification

- **Scope**:
  - **Users** will have the ability to:
    - View available desks in the library.
    - Book desks for a specific time period.
    - Cancel their bookings if needed.
  
  - **Administrators** will have the ability to:
    - Manage desk availability (mark desks as unavailable, add new desks).
    - Approve or deny desk reservations.
    - Monitor desk usage and booking trends.
  
- **Feasibility Justification**:
  - The project is feasible as it will be developed using **Java** for both the backend logic and the user interface (UI). Java is widely used and well-suited for building both server-side applications and client interfaces.
  - The system will use **SQL** to store user details, desk availability, and booking data. SQL databases are reliable and well-suited for managing structured data.
  - The project will use a simple user interface, potentially built with **JavaFX** or **Swing**, which are both capable of providing interactive desktop applications.
  - This system will help libraries reduce human error, improve user experience, and optimize desk usage management.
