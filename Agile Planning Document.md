## 1. User Stories

The following user stories were created by converting functional requirements from **Assignment 4** and use cases from **Assignment 5**. These stories follow the INVEST criteria and are mapped to the relevant system requirements.

| Story ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| US-001 | As a student, I want to search for an available desk so that I can reserve a study space. | Results load in ≤3 sec; only available desks displayed. | High |
| US-002 | As a student, I want to book a desk for a specific time slot so that I have a guaranteed place to study. | Booking confirmation is displayed and stored in the database. | High |
| US-003 | As a librarian, I want to update desk statuses so that students see real-time availability. | Desk status updates instantly when changed. | High |
| US-004 | As a student, I want to cancel my booking so that I can free up the desk for others. | Cancellation is processed successfully with a confirmation message. | Medium |
| US-005 | As a student, I want to receive a confirmation email after booking so that I have proof of my reservation. | Email is sent within 1 min of booking. | Medium |
| US-006 | As an administrator, I want to generate reports on desk usage so that I can analyze student trends. | Reports generate in ≤5 min with accurate data. | Medium |
| US-007 | As an IT staff member, I want system performance logs so that I can monitor uptime and errors. | Logs update in real-time and store data for 30 days. | Low |
| US-008 | As a student, I want to receive a reminder before my booking so that I don’t forget my reserved time. | Reminder is sent via email/SMS 15 min before booking time. | Low |

## 2. 📋 Product Backlog

The product backlog is prioritized using MoSCoW methodology, with effort estimates assigned to each user story. 

| Story ID | User Story | Priority (MoSCoW) | Effort Estimate | Dependencies |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| US-001 | Search for available desks | Must-have | 3 | None |
| US-002 | Book a desk for a specific time | Must-have | 5 | US-001 |
| US-003 | Update desk statuses in real-time | Must-have | 4 | None |
| US-004 | Cancel a booking | Should-have | 3 | US-002 |
| US-005 | Receive confirmation email after booking | Should-have | 2 | US-002 |
| US-006 | Generate desk usage reports | Could-have | 5 | None |
| US-007 | System performance logs | Won’t-have | 2 | None |
| US-008 | Send booking reminders | Could-have | 3 | US-002 |

### Justification for Prioritization:
- **Must-have stories** are essential for the core functionality of the desk booking system (e.g., searching for desks, booking desks, updating statuses).
- **Should-have stories** provide important but non-critical functionality (e.g., booking cancellation, confirmation emails).
- **Could-have stories** offer additional enhancements to user experience (e.g., reminders, reports).
- **Won’t-have stories** are deprioritized or excluded from the current sprint, but may be revisited in the future (e.g., system performance logs).

## 3.  Sprint Planning

### Sprint Goal:
**Sprint Goal:** Implement core desk booking and status update functionality to ensure that students can reserve desks and see real-time availability. The goal of this sprint is to deliver a basic but fully functional desk reservation system.

### Sprint Backlog:

| Task ID | Task Description | Assigned To | Estimated Hours | Status (To Do/In Progress/Done) |
|---------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| T-001   | Develop search API endpoint | Dev Team | 8 | To Do |
| T-002   | Design UI for desk search results page | UI/UX Team | 6 | To Do |
| T-003   | Implement desk booking functionality | Dev Team | 12 | To Do |
| T-004   | Implement real-time desk status update system | Dev Team | 10 | To Do |
| T-005   | Write unit tests for desk booking functionality | QA Team | 6 | To Do |
| T-006   | Set up database schema | Database Team | 8 | To Do |

## 4.  Traceability to Requirements

The user stories and tasks in this sprint align with the **functional requirements** outlined in **Assignment 4**, ensuring that the features developed directly contribute to meeting the project goals. Below is a mapping between the functional requirements and user stories:

| Requirement | User Story ID | Description |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| FR-001: Search for available desks | US-001 | Students can search for desks by availability. |
| FR-002: Book a desk | US-002 | Students can book desks for specific time slots. |
| FR-003: Update desk statuses in real-time | US-003 | Desk statuses are updated instantly when changes occur. |
| FR-004: Cancel a booking | US-004 | Students can cancel bookings to free up desks. |
| FR-005: Confirmation email | US-005 | Students receive email confirmation after booking. |
| FR-006: Reports on desk usage | US-006 | Administrators can generate reports on desk usage. |
