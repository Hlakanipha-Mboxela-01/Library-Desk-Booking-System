#  Reflection: Challenges in Prioritization, Estimation, and Aligning Agile with Personal Needs

As I worked through the Library Desk Booking System project, I faced several challenges related to prioritization, estimation, and aligning Agile practices with my personal needs. Being the only stakeholder in this project, I had to make all the decisions on my own, which was both empowering and overwhelming. In a typical Agile setup, these decisions would be shared and discussed with a team, but this wasn’t the case here, and that added complexity to the process.

## 1. **Prioritization**
One of the biggest challenges I encountered was determining which features to prioritize and how to classify them in the MoSCoW prioritization model. In a team setting, stakeholders provide clear input, and team members can collaborate to assess the importance of various features. However, as the sole stakeholder, I had to make all the prioritization decisions. This was both empowering and frustrating, as I had to rely heavily on my judgment.

For example, I had to decide whether to prioritize core functionalities like desk booking and real-time availability or whether additional features like sending reminders or generating usage reports were equally important. I often found myself second-guessing these decisions. What if I prioritized a feature that was nice to have but not truly essential? What if a certain feature would have a greater impact on the user experience but I overlooked it?

In the end, I found that the must have stories those that allowed students to reserve desks and check availability—were clear priorities. However, determining the right level of importance for the Should have and Could have stories, like confirmation emails and booking reminders, was more challenging. I had to remind myself that the project’s success was rooted in ensuring the core functionality worked first and foremost.

### Tip: Balancing Technical vs. User-Centric Stories
In Agile, it’s essential to balance both technical and user-centric stories. For instance, a technical story might involve optimizing database queries for performance, while a user-centric story could be about designing a seamless booking interface. These need to be prioritized together because the project can’t succeed without both functional and technical excellence. This balance is tricky when you're the sole stakeholder, as you need to ensure that the system’s functionality aligns with users’ needs while also maintaining security, performance, and scalability.

## 2. **Estimation**
Estimation was another area where I encountered resistance. In Agile, effort estimation is important for defining the amount of work required for each user story. But as a single person, estimating the effort for tasks like developing the search API endpoint or designing the user interface felt daunting. 

One way to estimate effort is through story points, and using a method like the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) helps to provide a relative measure of complexity and effort. Initially, I tried to use a simple number scale (1–5), but I found the Fibonacci sequence more effective in capturing the complexity of tasks. The larger numbers force you to think critically about the scope of a task.

For example, I initially estimated the API endpoint development would take 4 story points, but the task turned out to be more complex than I expected, especially when dealing with pagination and filtering. I should have estimated it higher (perhaps 5 or 8 points) after considering all the aspects involved.

I also learned that user-centric stories such as designing the user interface or handling booking cancellations—tend to be easier to estimate in story points, while technical stories, like setting up the database schema or optimizing performance, may require more thought and can be more prone to underestimation. Balancing these two types of stories with accurate estimates is essential for a smooth sprint.

### Tip: Using Story Points for Estimation
Story points, particularly the Fibonacci sequence, can help refine your estimation process. Larger values (e.g., 8 or 13) should prompt you to break a task into smaller pieces. This also helps in identifying potential blockers and understanding the complexity of a task before diving into it.

## 3. **Aligning Agile with Personal Needs**
Working within Agile frameworks requires frequent communication and collaboration, which I didn’t have. The absence of a team to bounce ideas off or share progress with made the Agile process feel somewhat isolating. I missed the typical feedback loops that drive Agile development, such as daily standups or sprint reviews. It felt difficult to maintain the flexibility that Agile promotes when there were no external inputs to keep me on track.

Additionally, the pressure to meet sprint goals alone sometimes caused me to focus on completing tasks within a specific timeframe rather than ensuring their quality. This internal struggle created resistance, as I constantly weighed the need to deliver quickly against the desire to produce the best possible result.

### Tip: Using Agile for Personal Projects
Even as the only stakeholder, I found Agile's principles valuable, especially when it came to maintaining flexibility. It was a challenge to switch between wearing the hat of both developer and stakeholder, but focusing on delivering incremental results and regularly assessing my progress helped maintain momentum. Reviewing the project against the **Agile manifesto** helped me realign when I felt stuck or overburdened by the process.

## Conclusion:
Overall, working on this project solo presented unique challenges, particularly in prioritization and estimation. I learned that Agile, when practiced alone, can feel disconnected from the core principles of collaboration and teamwork. However, the experience has taught me to trust my judgment more when prioritizing and estimating tasks, and I now understand the value of flexibility and self-reflection when working within Agile.
