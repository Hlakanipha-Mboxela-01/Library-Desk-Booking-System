# Kanban Board Customization

## Columns Overview

The Kanban board was customized with the following columns to help track tasks more efficiently throughout the sprint:

### 1. **To Do**
This column contains tasks that are planned but have not been started yet. These tasks are from our sprint backlog and are ready to be picked up by the team.

| **Task ID** | **Task Description**                                          | **Assigned To**     | **Estimated Hours** |  
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|  
| **T-001**   | Develop search API endpoint for desk search by availability   | Dev Team            | 8                   |  
| **T-002**   | Design UI for desk search results page                        | UI/UX Team          | 6                   |  
| **T-003**   | Implement desk booking functionality                          | Dev Team            | 12                  |  
| **T-004**   | Implement real-time desk status update system                  | Dev Team            | 10                  |  
| **T-005**   | Write unit tests for desk booking functionality                | QA Team             | 6                   |  
| **T-006**   | Set up database schema for desk reservations and statuses     | Database Team       | 8                   |  

### 2. **In Progress**
This column is for tasks that the team is actively working on. When a task moves from "To Do" to "In Progress," it indicates that work has started.

| **Task ID** | **Task Description**                                          | **Assigned To**     | **Estimated Hours** |  
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|  
| **T-001**   | Develop search API endpoint for desk search by availability   | Dev Team            | 8                   |  
| **T-003**   | Implement desk booking functionality                          | Dev Team            | 12                  |  

### 3. **Testing**
This column is for tasks that have been completed by the developers and are now being tested or validated by QA or the testing team.

| **Task ID** | **Task Description**                                          | **Assigned To**     | **Estimated Hours** |  
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|  
| **T-003**   | Implement desk booking functionality                          | Dev Team            | 12                  |  
| **T-005**   | Write unit tests for desk booking functionality                | QA Team             | 6                   |  

### 4. **Blocked**
Tasks that are facing issues or dependencies are placed in the "Blocked" column until they can continue. This highlights obstacles that need to be resolved before work can proceed.

| **Task ID** | **Task Description**                                          | **Assigned To**     | **Estimated Hours** |  
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|  
| **T-002**   | Design UI for desk search results page                        | UI/UX Team          | 6                   |  

### 5. **Done**
Once tasks are completed, tested, and validated, they are moved to the "Done" column. This represents fully completed tasks that have been delivered.

| **Task ID** | **Task Description**                                          | **Assigned To**     | **Estimated Hours** |  
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|  
| **T-001**   | Develop search API endpoint for desk search by availability   | Dev Team            | 8                   |  
| **T-002**   | Design UI for desk search results page                        | UI/UX Team          | 6                   |  
| **T-003**   | Implement desk booking functionality                          | Dev Team            | 12                  |  
| **T-004**   | Implement real-time desk status update system                  | Dev Team            | 10                  |  
| **T-005**   | Write unit tests for desk booking functionality                | QA Team             | 6                   |  
| **T-006**   | Set up database schema for desk reservations and statuses     | Database Team       | 8                   |  

## Customization Rationale

- **Testing**: The "Testing" column was added to ensure that tasks are validated after development. This is essential for maintaining high-quality standards and catching any issues before they are marked as complete.
- **Blocked**: The "Blocked" column helps identify tasks that are halted due to issues or dependencies. This provides visibility into any obstacles preventing progress, allowing the team to address them quickly.
