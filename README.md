# Library-Desk-Booking-System


## Project Description

The **Library Desk Booking System** is a Java-based application designed to streamline the desk reservation process in libraries. It allows users to check the availability of desks, make reservations, and cancel bookings. Administrators can manage desk availability, view reservations, and monitor the booking system's overall operation.

This system improves library management by eliminating the need for manual desk reservations, preventing errors, and enhancing the user experience.
