# Reflection: Challenges Faced in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

## Overview
In this section, I reflect on the challenges I encountered while balancing the diverse needs and concerns of the stakeholders in the development of the Library Desk Booking System. These challenges were important to recognize as they directly influenced the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. **Conflicting Needs Between Students and Librarians**
- **Challenge**: One of the most significant challenges was the conflict between the needs of the students (end users) and the librarians (system administrators). Students needed a quick, seamless, and user-friendly desk reservation system, while librarians required a more detailed, robust system for managing desk availability, tracking usage, and dealing with potential desk conflicts.
- **Resolution**: To address this, I designed the system to provide real-time desk availability for students while also allowing librarians to make modifications easily. This dual functionality allowed us to meet both sets of needs without sacrificing either.

### 2. **Performance vs. Security Needs**
- **Challenge**: Balancing performance and security was another challenge. The system needed to handle a large volume of users, especially during peak times when many students might try to reserve desks at once. However, security protocols, such as multi-factor authentication and encryption, could potentially slow down the system.
- **Resolution**: I implemented a layered security approach, where performance optimization was prioritized for desk reservation functions, while security measures were applied to critical data exchanges and user authentication processes. This helped ensure the system performed well under load while maintaining the required security standards.

### 3. **Scalability vs. Usability**
- **Challenge**: Another key challenge was designing the system to be scalable while ensuring it remained easy to use. As the university could potentially expand the system to multiple campuses or allow for thousands of desk reservations, scalability became crucial. However, the more complex the system, the more difficult it could be for users to navigate.
- **Resolution**: I focused on designing an intuitive interface that did not overwhelm the user with too many options, while also ensuring the system could be scaled up with minimal user interface changes. I used modular design principles, which allowed for future growth without compromising usability.

### 4. **Addressing Security Concerns**
- **Challenge**: Ensuring data security while keeping the system user-friendly was another significant challenge. The security officer emphasized the importance of safeguarding user data, particularly personal information and reservation history.
- **Resolution**: To address this, I incorporated strong encryption methods and data access controls, which were invisible to the end user. The system's design ensured that sensitive data was securely handled, while users were able to interact with the system in a straightforward, non-intrusive manner.

## Lessons Learned
- **Effective Communication**: One of the key lessons I learned was the importance of constant communication between stakeholders. Regular feedback sessions allowed me to better understand their concerns and adjust the system design accordingly.
- **Prioritization**: I also learned the importance of prioritizing requirements. While all stakeholders had valid concerns, I had to determine which were most critical to the systemâ€™s success and address those first.
- **Flexibility**: Balancing stakeholder needs also required flexibility. I had to adjust my initial design to accommodate new feedback, ensuring the system was adaptable as requirements evolved.

## Conclusion
The process of balancing stakeholder needs highlighted the complexity of designing a system that serves multiple, sometimes conflicting, requirements. The challenges were ultimately rewarding, as overcoming them led to a more robust, adaptable, and user-centric system.
