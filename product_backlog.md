##  Justification for Prioritization:

### **Must-have**:
- **Critical for system functionality** and directly impacts user experience and system security (e.g., desk booking functionality, encryption, uptime).

### **Should-have**:
- **Enhances user experience** but not crucial for system operation (e.g., confirmation emails, reports).

### **Could-have**:
- **Nice-to-have features** that can be implemented later if time allows (e.g., reminders, performance logs).
